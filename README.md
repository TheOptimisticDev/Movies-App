# Movies App Streamtime

## Overview

The Movies App Streamtime is a responsive web application designed and developed as part of my portfolio project. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for browsing and discovering movies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling and layout.
- **Sass**: Utilized to enhance CSS with variables, nesting, and other features.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for dynamic functionality and interactivity.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The application is built to provide a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

2. **Movie Listing**: Displays a curated list of movies with essential information such as title, poster, and release date.

3. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for movies using keywords, and the app dynamically updates the results.

4. **Detailed Movie Pages**: Clicking on a movie provides additional details, including a synopsis, cast, and reviews.

5. **Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort and filter movies based on criteria such as release date, genre, and rating.
